                    <b>What is Helix LT?</b>
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Helix LT is a streamlined HX guitar processor, that replaces not only a guitarist's pedalboard,
                    but also includes many Amps and Cabs and works in straith Front of the House (FOH) mode, that means
                    you
                    will not need additional Cabinet and Mic to get your sound to the public. It doesn't matter if you
                    are a
                    studio-recording artist, or playing in the garage band, or on the huge stage for tonns of people...
                    or
                    playing for yourself through small Cabinet ot even a headphones - you will get an incredible sound
                    out
                    of template presets or can create your own to form the sound you want or like!
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    This processor can hadle easily 2 guitars at the same time, or guitar + mic, or guitar + bass,
                    whatever
                    combination you would like. You can see the specs of the Helix LT <b><a href="#specs">here</a></b>.
                    Helix has 2
                    CPUs taking care of 2 PATHs which you can populate with different pedals, cabs, amps in any order
                    you
                    like, which opens wide the doors for creativity and very brave expirements with your sound.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Rest assured - this baby will not leave you indifferent when you try it!</h4>

                    <b>What sound do you want to get?</b>
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Are you a Rockabilly guitarist? Or Heavy Metal dude? Grunge? Jazz? Or all of the above in one
                    package?
                    Helix will satisfy your sound-scaping dreams and desires with a touch of a button! The button, which
                    is
                    programmable, by the way.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Besides all the presets, which are plenty, within each preset you can have up to 8 Snapshots, that
                    will
                    allow you to change your sound drestically without any pauses or moments of silence. So what these
                    Snapshots are good for?
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    Suppose you are playing the song where the verse, chorus and solo sounds are completely different.
                    With
                    regular pedalboard during live performance you would probably need to switch on/off several pedals
                    and
                    maybe even change some pedal settings.
                    Snapshots allow you to prepare all the pedal settings for each snapshot, including on/off for
                    different
                    pedals and when playing the song seamlessly change those settings with a push of the button, then
                    turn
                    to different snapshot.
                    Or even while playing solo you needed a stronger bite on the drive pedal and/or higher level of
                    delay/reverb mix -use Snapshot.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    Another cool feature - changing your settings on-the-go using the expression pedal. Suppose you are
                    on a
                    live rig and while playing you are not satisfied with the sound in this particular ambience. And the
                    song is rolling. What to do?
                    Choose the pedal you want to adjust, then choose the parameter, then using expression pedal you can
                    increase/decrease this parameter' setting untill you are satisfied with your sound.
